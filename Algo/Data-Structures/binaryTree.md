- Maximum Nodes at Level (i) = <code>2<sup>i</sup></code>
- Maximum Nodes with Tree Height (h) = <code>2<sup>h</sup> - 1</code>
- Minimum Height with (n) Nodes = <code>log₂(n + 1) - 1</code>
- Minimum Levels with (n) Leaves = <code>log₂(n)</code>

  - LevelOrder traversla - (left, right)
- depth-first traversal
  - PreOrder traversal  - (parent, left, right)
  - InOrder traversal   - (left, parent, right)
  - PostOrder traversal - (left, right, parent)

- **Edge** – Connection between one node to another.
- **Path** – A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
  - The direction of a path is strictly from top to bottom.
- **Level** – The number of connections between the node and the root.
- **Height** – The number of edges on the longest downward path between selected nodes.
- **Depth** – The number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.

- Leaf is not a Node, and acts only like a stop sign or Leaf is a Node, and other are Inner Nodes except Root.
- `height.root = 1`
- `depth.root = 0`
